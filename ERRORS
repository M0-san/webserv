If the server block do not contain localhost, you should bind to "0.0.0.0"

If you have multiple servers with the same ports, you should
- not try to create multiple servers with the same port,
- instead just create one and let the request handler to handle the routing between the servers by comparing the HOST header.
If the HOST exists in the config file, you should use it's config,
- else just use the first server block parsed.

check max body size before processing the request -> by mbani.
